# ‚ùì How to Use 
After putting the ASFM.jar file and the Start-ASFM.bat file in the folder where the server will be created,
run it. After that,
proceed in the order of the program.

# üåê Add language
By default, the language file is lang.json,
and the location is appdata/Roaming/ASFM/lang.json.

To add a language, simply align the language json component exactly and

put the language name you wrote down in the json file in setting.json.
It is recommended to enter Unicode characters due to broken text.
