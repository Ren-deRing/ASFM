# ‚ùì How to Use 
When you run the Start-ASFM.bat file,
it automatically installs the initial components and Java.

At initial startup, the language is set to en-us and can be changed on the main screen.

# üåê Add language
By default, the language file is lang.json,
and the location is appdata/Roaming/ASFM/lang.json.

To add a language, simply align the language json component exactly and

put the language name you wrote down in the json file in setting.json.
It is recommended to enter Unicode characters due to broken text.
